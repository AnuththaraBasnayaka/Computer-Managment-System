--my Part - Service and Warrenty Claims
*NewTech Company is the Client that we used and here is a discription about the function that I implemented. 
The company provides the service to the client for repair their electronic equipment including all kind of computers, 
printers, mobile accessories. This is the desktop application system therefore customer does not directly 
interact with system. Here Sale person take service details and information from the customer. 
He is responsible for the add details to the system. At first he is responsible for find whether that needed 
service is available in the service center by retrieving the details in the database. There are the changes in the
services provided the salesperson is responsible for update and maintain available service. If there is a service
type that is not provided that must delete from the system. If the customer brought the service item from the 
shop. It is need to search the warranty details corresponding to the item. Then create and add customer 
current service to the system if that customer takes service at very first from the shop. If not update and 
maintain details according to the current service. At this point it covers all the CRUD operations perform in the 
function. 
In addition after the service provides salesperson generate service charge bill to the customer. The customer 
needs to pay payment to payment sale and get his repair item. After happen overall process finally sale person 
generate a service provided report. By referring to this report NewTeach Company can take future decisions 
according to current situation
